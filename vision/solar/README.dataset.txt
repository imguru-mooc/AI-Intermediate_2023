This project labels solar panels collected via a DJI Mavic Air 2 flying over Rancho Santa Fe, California in August 2022. Both rooftop and backyard solar panels are labeled. It was used as the basis for the [Using Computer Vision with Drones for Georeferencing](https://blog.roboflow.com/georeferencing-drone-videos/) blog post and the [open source DJI aerial georeferencing project](https://github.com/roboflow-ai/dji-aerial-georeferencing).

53 images labeled with 267 polygons were used to train a computer vision model to detect solar panels from above. It's a demonstration of collecting and annotating data from a drone video and using that to train a machine learning model.
